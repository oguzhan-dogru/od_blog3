# **about me**

I have a track record in process control, machine learning, and data science. I've worked for the biggest oil company in Turkey, reporting to C-level execs periodically. Currently, I'm working on some of my faculty's most innovative and challenging projects. I developed cutting-edge products for our MNC partners in the energy, process automation, and manufacturing sectors. Leading project teams granted me excellent communication, operational excellence, and process optimization skills. Combined with my ability to work under pressure, it has made me a well-rounded project manager. I'm looking forward to sharpening my skills in a fast-paced, and energetic organization.
